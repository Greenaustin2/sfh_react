## Process

sixfingerhand.xyz is a straightforward web application utilizing create-react-app. A small number of external frameworks and modules were used, most notably Material UI for the Tree View menu and some styling, as well as a lightbox component from fslightboxjs. React Router was implemented to provide unique urls per project/release, and a centralized piece of state was used to hide and show releases and elements as a user interacts with the tree menu.

## Future Functionality

-Web store and payment integration
-Working with designer on updated styling and UI
