          Deconstructed Flag targets the overall political divide America has
          reached in light of current events. This print realizes dogmatic views
          and the inability to compromise that has left the country in a
          constant state of tension. Most importantly, Deconstructed Flag acts
          as a symbol to encourage empathy and communication over intolerance.
